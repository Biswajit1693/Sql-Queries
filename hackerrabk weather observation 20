   /* A median is defined as a number separating the higher half of a data set from the lower half. 
   Query the median of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION and round your answer to  decimal places.
   
   Input Format Using the table STATION*/
   
   Method 1:-
   
   with median as
   (select lat_n,row_number () over(order by lat_n) as rowlat,count(*) over () as cnt
   from station
   
   )
   
   select round (avg (lat_n),4)
   from median
   where mod(cnt,2)= 0 AND rowlat IN ((cnt/2), ((cnt/2)+1)) OR
         mod(cnt,2) =1 AND rowlat = floor(cnt/2)+1;
         
         
    Method 2:
    
    with median as
    (select lat_n,row_number() over(order by lat_n) as row_asc,row_number() over (order by lat_n desc) as row_desc
    from station
    
    )
    select round(avg(lat_n)::numeric,4)    /* Line no 31- you can also use round(cast(avg(lat_n) as numeric),4)*/
    from median 
    where abs(row_asc - row_desc) <= 1
