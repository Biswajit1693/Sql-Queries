create table friends (ID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,FRIEND_ID INT)
create table packages (ID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,SALARY FLOAT)

INSERT INTO STUDENTS VALUES
(1,'Ashley'),
(2,'Samantha'),
(3,'Julia'),
(4,'Scarlet');

INSERT INTO friends VALUES
(1,2),
(2,3),
(3,4),
(4,1);
INSERT INTO packages VALUES
(1,15.20),
(2,10.06),
(3,11.55),
(4,12.12);
select * from students
select * from friends
select * from packages

with a as
(select s.id,s.name,f.friend_id
from students as s
join friends as f
on f.id = s.id
),b as
(select a.id,a.name,a.friend_id,p.salary as s1,s.name as bst from a
join students as s
on a.friend_id = s.id
join packages as p
on a.id = p.id
),c as
(select b.*,p.salary as s2
from b
join packages as p
on b.friend_id = p.id
 )
 
select name from c
where s1<s2
order by c.s2
